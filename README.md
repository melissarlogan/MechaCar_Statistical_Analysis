## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model, the smaller the amount the less likely to provide variance. According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. variances that would provide random amount of variance to the model are vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. By looking at the p-value, which is less than 0.05 this determines that the slope is not 0. 


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The r squared value from this regression is 0.714 this r squared shows a strong correlation between the data sets meaning that in 71% of tests the linear regression will predict the mpg values correct.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

Per the total summary below, the variance within the suspension coils is shown to be 62, meaning that per the total review it does not exceed the 100 pounds per square inch

Per the Lot summary this shows that while in total it doesnâ€™t exceed the 100-pound threshold, Lot 3 exceed that with a variance of 170, lot 1 and 2 both have variances <10. This means that in the total summary, the 62 variance is the average across the lots, and majority of this variance can be attributed to Lot 3. Lot 3 should be rejected.
